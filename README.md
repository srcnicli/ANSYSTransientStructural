Use of FEM simulations to model the response of oocytes during exposure to CPA solutions


Oocyte deformation (i.e., volume changes) and associated changes in hydrostatic pressure during EG exposure were modeled using FEM simulations. You can find the detailed information about process and the reason of modeling in my paper.
